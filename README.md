# raspberry_pi_waveshare_7_inch_HDMI_config

The configuration for the Waveshare touchscreen HDMI screen.

Since I posted this Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xuFqrApfi4

I've had a few requests asking how to configure the screen, so here's the config. It sits in the root directory of my raspberry pi 2 SD Card.

Note that the config doesn't go right at the end of the file as otherwise it won't be picked up until its too late in the boot sequence.

Obviously, change the configuration parameters to suit your needs if you have a higher resolution screen, etc.

Enjoy!
